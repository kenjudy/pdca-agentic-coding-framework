"""Constraints on the LLM-as-judge rubrics themselves.

A rubric is the measuring instrument. When it is wrong, every scenario it scores is wrong
in the same direction at once, and the failure looks like flaky scenarios rather than a
broken instrument -- which is how issue #136 presented.

Two rounds of prose edits to rubric_2 were measured and REVERTED (see #136): telling the
judge what not to penalise made those things salient and it penalised them harder. Assert
what the rubric must not SAY, sparingly; do not assume an added instruction will be obeyed.
